# Clara's Boilerplate

This is my custom boilerplate just for me. This makes projects quicker to start and covers some basic issues in cross browser compactibility. 

##Notes : 
- Based on [HTML5 Boilerplate] (http://html5boilerplate.com/)
- Includes [SCSS for foundation] framework (https://github.com/zurb/foundation)
- Updates directory structure so assets are contained in the assets directory. 


## How to use this : 
1. On the main repository page, click the 'download ZIP' button to get a Zip file of the Boilerplate.
2. Extract the downloaded zip file and rename the directory to the name of the new project you want to start with the Boilerplate - this will be the root directory. 
3. Move the project root directory from you downloads directory to where you keep your projects.
4. Start work on your new project...
